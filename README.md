# Disclaimer:

This project was created at a hackathon after I had taken one programming course. It's some of the worst code I've ever written. But it kinda works. 

## To run the project,

Navigate to src/project, and compile the source using javac:

```Sh
javac . CodonWindow.java;
javac . CodonDriver.java;
javac . PlayMusic.java;
```

Then run the program from the **root** of the project directory:

```Sh
java src/project/CodonDriver
```
