# Disclaimer:

This project was created at a hackathon after I had taken one programming course. It is therefore not an accurate reflection of clean coding practices that I have now come to appreciate.

That said,

* The main method can be found in CodonDriver.java under The-Human-Song/src/project
* Make sure to run the project above the src directory after compiling using javac
* I intend to write a script to create package dependencies to make setup much simpler :)
